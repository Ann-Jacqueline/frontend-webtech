# WeatherWorks-frontend
This is the frontend component of the Weatherworks Vue JS Weather App, which is architected with a frontend component and a backend component linked to a PostgreSQL database. [https://github.com/Ann-Jacqueline/backend-webtech/] The app was developed by myself, Ann-Jacqueline Viola Kaldjob, as part of my Web Technologies module of the third semester at the University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics Berlin (HTW). The central functionality of this Vue JS component is data retrieval, data flow management, and data exchange with the backend and the PostgreSQL database using axios requests to the backend. Responsible for this frontend-side management is the management store, which centrally supplies all Vue components with data, extracts data, and exchanges this data with the backend via POST, GET, or DELETE requests, thus creating an interlinked system. The data management functions dually, with the frontend-side managed by the management store and the backend-side handled by the PostgreSQL database.
